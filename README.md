ceres-mle
=========

A maximum likelihood estimator using Google's [ceres-solver](http://ceres-solver.org/) minimizer.

Works with version `1.10.0rc1` of ceres.

Currently, there's only a simple demo that fits a normal distribution to a dataset.

A python script is provided that displays the data and fit.
